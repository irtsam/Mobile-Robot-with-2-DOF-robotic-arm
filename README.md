# Mobile-Robot-with-2-DOF-robotic-arm
This is a project for simulating a mobile Manipulator with a 3DOF robotic arm. 
The following are code desciptions:
1. Forward Kinematics: Implemented 2D kinematics equations for the 2DOF roobotic arm
2. Inverse Kinematics: For calculating motor angles to achieve desired end affector positions. This is also used for simulation in the Simrobo code as well as for determining angles when driving the arm motors.
3. Transformrobo: This is the main code block which contains code for moving the animated mobile manipulator simulation code blocks.
4. Robomove: Code for interfacing with Arduino the robot DC motors to move the robot forward, left, right etc.
5. SimRobo: The starting point for the simulation code.
